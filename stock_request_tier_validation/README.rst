Installation
============

This module depends on ``base_tier_validation``. You can find it at
`OCA/server-ux <https://github.com/OCA/server-ux>`_

Configuration
=============

A default tier is created allowing Stock Request Manager to approve Stock
Request and Stock Request Orders.

In addition, you may want to add more tiers, so:

#. Go to *Settings > Technical > Tier Validations > Tier Definition*.
#. Create as many tiers as you want for Stock Request model.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Create a Stock Request triggering at least one "Tier Definition".
#. Click on *Request Validation* button.
#. Under the tab *Reviews* have a look to pending reviews and their statuses.
#. Once all reviews are validated button to *Confirm* will be shown.

Additional features:

* You can filter the Stock Request requesting your review through the filter *Needs my
  Review*.
* User with rights to confirm the Stock Request (validate all tiers that would
  be generated) can directly do the operation, this is, there is no need for
  her/him to request a validation.
