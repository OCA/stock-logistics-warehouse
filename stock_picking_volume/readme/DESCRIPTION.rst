For some processes, you need to know the volume of your stock picking. This could
be useful for example to know the device to use to process it. An other use case
could be to know how many trucks you need to deliver your products.

By default, the delivery module from Odoo will compute the picking weight.
Unfortunately, it will not compute the volume. This module will add the volume
computation to the picking and to the stock move. This information will be
stored in the database and will be available on the picking form view and
on the stock move form view.
