For some processes, you need to know the volume of your stock picking. This could
be useful for example to know the device to use to process it. An other use case
could be to know how many trucks you need to deliver your products.

By default, the delivery module from Odoo will compute the picking weight.
Unfortunately, it will not compute the volume. This module will add the volume
computation to the picking and to the stock move. This information will be
stored in the database and will be available on the picking form view and
on the stock move form view.

Usage
=====

In order to have a pertinent value for the computed volume, the dimension fields
must be set on all the products.

The computed volume depends on the move state.

* If the move is done, the volume is the volume for the qty done.
* If the move is cancelled or draft waiting, the volume is the volume for the
  qty to do.
* if the move is available or partially available, the volume is the volume
  for the reserved quantity.

When the module is installed on an existing database, the volume field is only
computed for the stock moves of pickings not yet processed.
The moves in a cancelled or done picking are not updated to avoid to freeze the
database for a long time during the upgrade process if it contains a lot of
stock moves and pickings.
