The aim of this module is to mark internal locations where no product
should transit. Indeed, in complex warehouse setups, we may have a
complicated tree of internal locations with parent locations only used
to create the hierarchy of the internal locations. We may want to avoid
to put stock on these parent internal locations since they are not
physical locations, they just represent a zone of the warehouse. Theses
locations must have *Location Type* set to *Internal Location* because
they belong to a warehouse (they can't be configured with *Location
Type* set to *View*, cf [Odoo bug
\#26679](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/26679)). With this module,
you will be able to enable a new option *Block stock entrance* for these
locations.
