============================
Putaway strategy per product
============================

This module extends the functionality of the odoo putaway strategy.
It defines a new type of putaway strategy where users can set a specific
stock location per product.

On the product form, the case, rack, location fields are replaced with a
specific putaway strategy and location id for the product.

A putaway strategy can be used to ensure that incoming products will be
stored in the location set on the product form.

A recommended set-up is to create a separate putaway strategy for each
warehouse. This will ensure that the same product will be placed in the
appropriate location in each warehouse it is received.
