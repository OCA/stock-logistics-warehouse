Synchronize a Product Putaway Location from an inventory. Note that this module assumes that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the location and putaway strategy, and if the location currently has no putaway strategy, an error will be raised.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Usage
=====

From a validated stock adjustment, use action -> Generate putaway per product.

The end result is that the location's putaway strategy will be updated, so that all products (and their locations) from the inventory will show up on the putaway strategy.
