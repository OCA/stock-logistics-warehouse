Make exhaustive Inventories aware of their Sub-Inventories.
===========================================================

This module allows an inventory to contain a general Location,
and it's sub-inventories to contain some of it's sub-Locations.
It will prevent you from setting the Inventories and sub-Inventories
in inconsistent status.

This module will be installed automatically if the modules
"stock_inventory_location" and "stock_inventory_hierarchical" are both
installed.
You must keep this module installed to ensure proper functioning.
