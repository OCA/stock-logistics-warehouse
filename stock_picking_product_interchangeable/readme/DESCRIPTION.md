This module implements "interchangeable" products. If an interchangeable
product is not available in stock in requested quantity its substitute
products will be added to picking to complete the order.

Eg there is an "English Breakfast" tea and "Breakfast in England" tea
which are absolutely the same inside and have the same price. Only
package labels are different. And our customers don't care which of them
will be actually delivered.

NB: Interchangeable products substitute each other. Eg if "English
Breakfast" can substitutes "Breakfast in England" then "Breakfast in
England" can substitute "English Breakfast".
