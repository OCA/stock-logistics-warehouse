This module implements "interchangeable" products. If an interchangeable product is not available in stock in requested quantity its substitute products will be added to picking to complete the order.

Eg there is an "English Breakfast" tea and "Breakfast in England" tea which are absolutely the same inside and have the same price. Only package labels are different. And our customers don't care which of them will be actually delivered.

NB: Interchangeable products substitute each other. Eg if "English Breakfast" can substitutes "Breakfast in England" then "Breakfast in England" can substitute "English Breakfast".
