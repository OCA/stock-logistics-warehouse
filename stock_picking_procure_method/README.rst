This module adds the possibility to set the supply method to *Apply
Procurement Rules* in the pickings, which is normally set to *Take From
Stock* by default.

This way, you can configure MTO flows triggered from the picking itself.

Installation
============

This module is useless without either Odoo's mrp or purchase modules (or
both). Depending on your needs you should install them in advance.

Configuration
=============

This is an example scenario with two warehouses. WH2 will be allways
supplied through WH1.

Common steps to mrp and purchase procurements:

1. Go to *Inventory > Configuration > Settings > Warehouse* and set
   *Multi-Step Routes* on.
2. Go to *Inventory > Configuration > Warehouse Management > Warehouses*
3. Create **WH1** with either *Manufacture to Resupply* or *Buy to
   Resupply* this warehouse or both set.
4. Create **WH2** setting off *Manufacture to Resupply* and *Buy to
   Resupply*. Set **WH1** as the *Resupply Warehouse*.
5. Go to *Inventory > Configuration > Warehouse Management > Routes* and
   click on the *Make To Order* one.
6. Add a new *Procurement Rule* with these settings and save:

   -  Name: *WH1 -> WH2-MTO*
   -  Action: *Pull From*
   -  Operation Type: *WH1: Internal Transfers*
   -  Source Location: *WH1/Stock*
   -  Destination Location: *WH2/Stock*
   -  Move Supply Method: *Take From Stock*
   -  Propagation of Procurement Group: *Propagate*
   -  Propagate cancel and split: True
   -  Warehouse to Propagate: *WH1*

Now, if you want to trigger a manufacture:

   -  Create a stockable product with a BoM list.
   -  In the product's *Inventory > Routes section* set *Make To Order*
      and *Manufacture* on.

Or if you want to trigger a purchase:

   -  Create a stockable product with a vendor.
   -  In the product's *Inventory > Routes section* set *Make To Order*
      and *Purchase* on.

Usage
=====

After configuring you procurement rules and your product routes:

1. Go to *Inventory > Dashboard* and click on the *more options* icon
   (☰).
2. Choose *New > Planned Transfer*.
3. Set an origin and destination that is considered in the routes
   procurement rules.
4. Set *Supply Method* to *Apply Procurement Rules*.
5. Set the products and quantities you want to supply.
6. Save and click on *Mark as To Do*.
7. Depending on the product's supply type a new MO or a new PO should be
   created.
