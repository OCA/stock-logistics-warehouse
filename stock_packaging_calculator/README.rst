Usage
=====

Imagine you have the following packagings:

-  Pallet: 1000 Units
-  Big box: 500 Units
-  Box: 50 Units

and you have to pick from your warehouse 2860 Units.

Then you can do:

   ::

      >>> product.product_qty_by_packaging(2860)

      [
          {"id": 1, "qty": 2, "name": "Pallet"},
          {"id": 2, "qty": 1, "name": "Big box"},
          {"id": 3, "qty": 7, "name": "Box"},
          {"id": 100, "qty": 10, "name": "Units"},
      ]

With this you can show a proper message to warehouse operators to
quickly pick the quantity they need.

Optionally you can get contained packaging by passing with_contained
flag:

   ::

      >>> product.product_qty_by_packaging(2860, with_contained=True)

      [
          {"id": 1, "qty": 2, "name": "Pallet", "contained": [{"id": 2, "qty": 2, "name": "Big box"}]},
          {"id": 2, "qty": 1, "name": "Big box", "contained": [{"id": 3, "qty": 10, "name": "Box"}]},
          {"id": 3, "qty": 7, "name": "Box", "contained": [{"id": 100, "qty": 50, "name": "Units"}]},
          {"id": 100, "qty": 10, "name": "Units", "contained": []},},
      ]

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

TODO

1. Fractional quantities (eg: 0.5 Kg) are lost when counting units
2. Maybe rely on packaging_uom
