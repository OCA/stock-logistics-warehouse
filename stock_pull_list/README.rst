The pull list checks the stock situation at the given location and calculates
the shortfall quantities (quantity needed to cover all needs) for products.
Procurements can be created for these shortfall quantities.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.
