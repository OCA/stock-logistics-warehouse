This module adds rules for advanced reservation / removal strategies.

Rules are applied on a location and its sub-locations.

A rule can exclude quants or locations based on configurable criteria,
and based on the selected quants, apply advanced removal strategies.

The rules have a sequence, which will be respected for the reservation.
So even without filter or advanced removal strategies, we can give a priority to
reserve in a location before another.

The advanced removal strategies are applied on top of the default one (fifo,
fefo, ...).

The included advanced removal strategies are:

* Default Removal Strategy: apply the default configured one (fifo, fefo, ...)
* Empty Bins: goods are removed from a bin only if the bin will be empty after
  the removal (favor largest bins first to minimize the number of operations,
  then apply the default removal strategy for equal quantities).
* Full Packaging: tries to remove full packaging (configured on the products)
  first, by largest to smallest package or based on a pre-selected package
  (default removal strategy is then applied for equal quantities).

Examples of scenario:

rules:

* location A: no filter, no advanced removal strategy
* location B: no filter, Empty Bins
* location C: no filter, no  advanced removal strategy

result:

* take what is available in location A
* then take in location B if available, only if bin(s) are emptied
* then take what is available in location C

The module is meant to be extensible, with a core mechanism on which new rules
and advanced removal strategies can be added.

Configuration
=============

The configuration of the rules is done in "Inventory > Configuration > Stock Reservation Rules".

Creation of a rule:

Properties that define where the rule will be applied:

* Location: Define where the rule will look for goods (a parent of the move's source location).
* Rule Domain: The rule is used only if the Stock Move matches the domain.

Removal rules for the locations:

* Quants Domain: this domain includes/excludes quants based on a domain.
* Advanced Removal Strategy: the strategy that will be used for this location
  and sub-location when the rule is used.

The sequences have to be sorted in the view list to define the reservation priorities.

Usage
=====

If you are using a database with demo data, you can give a try
to the following scenario to understand how it works.

The demo data created by the module contains:

A product: Funky Socks

3 Locations:

* Stock / Zone A / Bin A1: 200 Funky socks
* Stock / Zone B / Bin B1: 100 Funky socks
* Stock / Zone C / Bin C1: 100 Funky socks

3 Reservation Rules, in the following order

* Zone A must have full quantities
* Zone B
* Zone C

2 Delivery Orders:

* Origin: Outgoing shipment (reservation rules demo 1)
* Origin: Outgoing shipment (reservation rules demo 2)

Scenario:

* Activate Storage Locations and Multi-Warehouses
* You can open Inventory > Configuration > Stock Reservation Rules to activate
  and see the rules (by default in demo, the rules are created inactive)
* Open Transfer: Outgoing shipment (reservation rules demo 1)
* Check availability: it has 150 units, as it will not empty Zone A, it will not
  take products there, it should take 100 in B and 50 in C (following the rules
  order)
* Unreserve this transfer (to test the second case)
* Open Transfer: Outgoing shipment (reservation rules demo 2)
* Check availability: it has 250 units, it can empty Zone A, it will take 200 in
  Bin A1 and 50 in Bin B1.
* If you want to explore further, you can add a custom domain to exclude rules
  (for instance, a product category will not use Zone B).
