This module extends the functionality of Inventory Adjustment to allow you to
exclude all the sublocations when doing an inventory adjustment for a
given location.

Sometimes we just want to make an inventory adjustment of just one shelf, or
space and forget about extra subdivisions in the location. In other cases we
do inventories of smaller locations contained in our stock, so we don't want
to count them again when doing an inventory adjustment of the parent location.
E.g. if we apply a cycle count strategy.
