This module allows users users to define what unit of measure should be used
in procurements created from minimum stock rules.

A typical use case would be a product that is stocked in centimeters, and
needs to be restocked in meters from another warehouse. When the picking is
created, the quantity to be transferred will be expressed in meters, making
it easier for the people responsible for the transfers to understand the
requirement.
