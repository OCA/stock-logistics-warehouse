This modules improves the way the volume is computed on a stock.move by
taking into account the volume of the potential product packaging that
can be picked to fulfill the move.

The potential packaging that can be picked for a move are computed by
the module *stock_packaging_calculator*. Thanks to this module we can
compute the best distribution of the packaging to uses to fulfill a
specific quantity of a product. (This information is important for the
picking operators to minimize the number of manipulations to do. Even if
this information is not available into the Odoo UI, The *Shopfloor*
addon takes advantage of it to propose the best picking strategy to the
user).

By default the volume information is not available on the product
packaging. Hopefully the module *product_packaging_dimension* provides
this information.

Since the volume information is not a mandatory field on the product
packaging when we ask for the best distribution of the packaging,
packaging without volume information are ignored. In this way we ensure
that the volume of the packaging is only taken into account when it's
relevant otherwise we fallback on the volume of the products.

Usage
=====

This modules makes sense only if you manage the volume information on
your product packaging definitions. If you don't, you can ignore this
module.
