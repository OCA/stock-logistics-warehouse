===========
Quant merge
===========

Odoo splits quants each time a reservation is done: this module makes Odoo
merge them back if they still meet the following requirements:

* same product
* same serial number/lot
* same location
* same package

Usage
=====

The merge is done automatically when a reservation is undone. No user intervention is needed.
