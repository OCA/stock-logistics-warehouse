This module provides the capability to execute a cycle count strategy in a
warehouse through different rules defined by the user. Cycle count is an
alternative to full wall-to-wall physical inventories in which little
portions (stock locations) of the stock are selected to count on a regular
basis.

The system propose locations in which to perform a inventory adjustment every
day based on a set of rules defined for the warehouse. In addition the system
can propose Zero-Confirmations which are simple and opportunistic counts to
check whether a locations has actually became empty or not.

With this strategy it is possible to:

* Remove the need to perform full physical inventories and to stop the
  production in the warehouse.
* Measure the accuracy of the inventory records and improve it.
* Correct inventory errors earlier and prevent them to become bigger.
