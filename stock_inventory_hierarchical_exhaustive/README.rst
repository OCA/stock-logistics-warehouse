Make exhaustive inventories aware of their sub-inventories
==========================================================

This module relaxes the controls made by the module
`stock_inventory_exhaustive` when `stock_inventory_hierarchical` is installed.
Normally we make sure that all the sub-locations have been entered at least
once in an inventory lines, but if there are sub-inventories it is sufficient
that the location is entered in their lines.

This module will be installed automatically if the modules
"stock_inventory_exhaustive" and "stock_inventory_hierarchical" are both
installed.
You should keep this module installed to ensure proper functioning.
