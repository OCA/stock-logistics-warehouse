  In this file, i check rules about hierarchical inventories.
  Children date must be the same of parent date for each state,
  the state of parent and children can change only if conditions are correct.
-
  Check if date of children are the same as the parent's.
-
  !python {model: stock.inventory}: |
    parent_date = self.read(
      cr, uid, [ref('stock_inventory_parent0')], ['date'])[0]['date']
    child_1_date = self.read(
      cr, uid, [ref('child_1_id')], ['date'])[0]['date']
    assert child_1_date == parent_date, "Date are different: %s - %s" % (parent_date, child_1_date)

    child_2_date = self.read(
      cr, uid, [ref('child_2_id')], ['date'])[0]['date']
    assert child_2_date == parent_date, "Date are different: %s - %s" % (parent_date, child_2_date)

-
  Check if children cannot be canceled if the parent was not canceled.
  I'll try to cancel both children inventory while parent inventory having "draft" state.
  After, i'll verify the state of each inventory.
-
  !python {model: stock.inventory}: |
    from stock_inventory_hierarchical import HierarchicalInventoryException
    try:
      self.action_cancel_inventory(cr, uid, [ref('child_1_id')])
    except HierarchicalInventoryException as e:
      log("Good ! The Inventory could not be canceled: %s" % e)
    try:
      self.action_cancel_inventory(cr, uid, [ref('child_2_id')])
    except HierarchicalInventoryException as e:
      log("Good ! The Inventory could not be canceled: %s" % e)
    child_1_state = self.read(cr, uid, [ref('child_1_id')], ['state'])[0]['state']
    assert child_1_state == 'draft', "Child inventory 1 have '%s' state. It should be 'draft'" % child_1_state
    child_2_state = self.read(cr, uid, [ref('child_2_id')], ['state'])[0]['state']
    assert child_2_state == 'draft', "Child inventory 2 have '%s' state. It should be 'draft'" % child_2_state

-
  Check if children inventory have confirm state before confirm parent inventory.
  To check this, i'll try to confirm parent inventory when children inventory having "draft" state,
  and i'll check if state is still 'draft'.
-
  !python {model: stock.inventory}: |
    from stock_inventory_hierarchical import HierarchicalInventoryException
    try:
      self.action_confirm(cr, uid, [ref('stock_inventory_parent0')])
    except HierarchicalInventoryException as e:
      log("Good, the inventory could not be confirmed: %s", e)
    parent_state = self.read(cr, uid, [ref('stock_inventory_parent0')], ['state'])[0]['state']
    assert parent_state == 'draft', "Parent inventory have '%s' state. It should be 'draft'" % parent_state

-
  In order, i'll confirm the children inventories, and the parent inventory after.
-
  !python {model: stock.inventory}: |
    self.action_confirm(cr, uid, [ref('child_1_id')])
    child_1_state = self.read(cr, uid, [ref('child_1_id')], ['state'])[0]['state']
    assert child_1_state == 'confirm', "Child inventory 1 have '%s' state. It should be 'confirm'" % child_1_state

    self.action_confirm(cr, uid, [ref('child_2_id')])
    child_2_state = self.read(cr, uid, [ref('child_2_id')], ['state'])[0]['state']
    assert child_2_state == 'confirm', "Child inventory 2 have '%s' state. It should be 'confirm'" % child_2_state

    self.action_confirm(cr, uid, [ref('stock_inventory_parent0')])
    parent_state = self.read(cr, uid, [ref('stock_inventory_parent0')], ['state'])[0]['state']
    assert parent_state == 'confirm', "Parent inventory have '%s' state. It should be 'confirm'" % parent_state

-
  Check if children inventory have done state before validate parent inventory.
  I'll try to validate parent inventory before children.
-
  !python {model: stock.inventory}: |
    from stock_inventory_hierarchical import HierarchicalInventoryException
    try:
      self.action_done(cr, uid, [ref('stock_inventory_parent0')])
    except HierarchicalInventoryException as e:
      log("Good, the inventory could not be validated: %s", e)
    parent_state = self.read(cr, uid, [ref('stock_inventory_parent0')], ['state'])[0]['state']
    assert parent_state == 'confirm', "Parent inventory have '%s' state. It should be 'confirm'" % parent_state

-
  Now, i'll validate all children inventory before validate the parent.
-
  !python {model: stock.inventory}: |
    self.action_done(cr, uid, [ref('child_1_id')])
    child_1_state = self.read(cr, uid, [ref('child_1_id')], ['state'])[0]['state']
    assert child_1_state == 'done', "Child inventory 1 have '%s' state. It should be 'done'" % child_1_state

    self.action_done(cr, uid, [ref('child_2_id')])
    child_2_state = self.read(cr, uid, [ref('child_2_id')], ['state'])[0]['state']
    assert child_2_state == 'done', "Child inventory 2 have '%s' state. It should be 'done'" % child_2_state

    self.action_done(cr, uid, [ref('stock_inventory_parent0')])
    parent_state = self.read(cr, uid, [ref('stock_inventory_parent0')], ['state'])[0]['state']
    assert parent_state == 'done', "Parent inventory have '%s' state. It should be 'done'" % parent_state
