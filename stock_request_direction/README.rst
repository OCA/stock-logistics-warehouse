This module was written to allow users to request products to be transferred
from or to your warehouses. They can specify the direction and don't have to
bother selecting the inventory location.

Usage
=====

Creation
~~~~~~~~

* Go to Stock Requests > Stock Requests
* Create or select a stock request
* Provide a product, quantity, direction and expected date
* Click Confirm

Upon confirmation, the request will be reviewed by the warehouse team who can
define the appropriate route.

In case that transfers are created, the user will be able to access to them
from the button 'Transfers' available in the Stock Request.

Cancel

When the user cancels a Stock Request, the related pending stock moves will be
also cancelled.
