This module adds the associated warehouse to every location. If we have a tree of locations and sublocations, this module will update the associated warehouse every time we modify a location parent.
If a location changes its father location, it will change its associated warehouse and all its childs too.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Configuration
=============

To use the module, our  instance must be configured first:
We have to go to configuration > settings and check the box in the warehouse section called "storage locations".

Usage
=====

The usage of this module is automatic but here's an explanation to force its behavior.
Go to Configuration>Locations and select a location that at least has one child. Edit the location's "Parent Location" to a different one and save the changes. Once the changes are saved, "Associated Warehouse" will be updated with a new warehouse. After this, go to any of its children and check the info: if things go well, "Associated Warehouse" will have changed too.
