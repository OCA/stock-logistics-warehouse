Transfers have a “star” widget, next to the transfer title, to mark them as priority.

Automatic reservation will only be done for starred Transfers.

The non-starred transfer will need manual reservation.
This is done as usual, using the “Check Availability” button.

The “Check Availability” is made available also in the Action menu,
to allow triggering reservations in bulk, from the Transfers list view.
