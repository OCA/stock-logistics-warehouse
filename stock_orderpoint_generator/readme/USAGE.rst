By activating the "Create Rules Automatically" on a reordering rule template,
you are able to select a list of products. Any change on the template will then
be replicated on the products Reordering Rules. The change is not immediate as
it is processed by a scheduled action.

Lastly, you can promptly create Reordering Rules for a product or a product
template using the "Reordering Rules Generator". Note that it will replace all
the existing rules for the product. You will usually not want to use this
feature on products that have Automatic Reordering Rules Templates.
