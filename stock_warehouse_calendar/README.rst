This module adds a Calendar to the Warehouse. This calendar can then used as
the basis of the proper computation of start/end dates based on lead times in
this and other modules.

In this module, the calendar considered in the computation of start date of
stock moves and pickings created from procurements, where the lead time
is used.

Configuration
=============

* Go to *Settings* and activate the developer mode.

* Go to *Settings > Technical > Resource > Working Time* and define your
  resource calendar.

* Go to *Inventory > Configuration > Warehouse Management > Warehouses*
  and assign the Resource Calendar.

* Go to *Inventory > Configuration > Settings* and in *Warehouse* mark
  'Multi-Step Routes option'.

* Go to *Inventory > Configuration > Warehouse Management > Routes* and
  set up the proper delays in the procurement rules where 'action'
  is 'Move From Another Location'.

Usage
=====

When a picking is created out of a procurement evaluation (from an
orderpoint, MTO,...) the calendar is considered in the computation of the
expected date of the picking and moves. For example, if it takes 1 day to
execute a stock transfer from another warehouse and it is Monday, the picking
to resupply will be created with expected start date on the previous Friday,
if the warehouse operates under a Mo-Fri working calendar.
