This module adds a Calendar to the Warehouse. This calendar can then
used as the basis of the proper computation of start/end dates based on
lead times in this and other modules.

In this module, the calendar considered in the computation of start date
of stock moves and pickings created from procurements, where the lead
time is used.

Configuration
=============

-  Go to *Settings* and activate the developer mode.
-  Go to *Settings > Technical > Resource > Working Time* and define
   your resource calendar.
-  Go to *Inventory > Configuration > Warehouse Management > Warehouses*
   and assign the Resource Calendar.
-  Go to *Inventory > Configuration > Settings* and in *Warehouse* mark
   'Multi-Step Routes option'.
-  Go to *Inventory > Configuration > Warehouse Management > Routes* and
   set up the proper delays in the stock rules where 'action' is 'Move
   From Another Location'.

Usage
=====

When a picking is created out of a procurement evaluation (from an
orderpoint, MTO,...) the calendar is considered in the computation of
the expected date of the picking and moves. For example, if it takes 1
day to execute a stock transfer from another warehouse and it is Monday,
the picking to resupply will be created with expected start date on the
previous Friday, if the warehouse operates under a Mo-Fri working
calendar.
