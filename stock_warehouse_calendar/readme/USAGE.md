When a picking is created out of a procurement evaluation (from an
orderpoint, MTO,...) the calendar is considered in the computation of
the expected date of the picking and moves. For example, if it takes 1
day to execute a stock transfer from another warehouse and it is Monday,
the picking to resupply will be created with expected start date on the
previous Friday, if the warehouse operates under a Mo-Fri working
calendar.
