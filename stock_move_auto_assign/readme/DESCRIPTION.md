Automatically check availability of stock moves when a move is set to
"done".

It uses queue jobs to verify the availability in order to have a minimal
impact on the user operations.

The conditions to trigger the check are:

- A move is marked as done
- The destination locations of the move lines are internal
- The move doesn't have successors in a chain of moves

At this point, jobs are generated:

- One job per product
- Any move waiting for stock in a parent (or same) location of the
  internal destination locations from the done move has its availability
  checked

Only one job is generated for an identical set of (product, locations).
