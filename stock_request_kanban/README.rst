On most companies there are products that must be purchased often but cannot be
stored as a usual product because no consumption moves are made.
Usually, they are stored as consumables or putaway rules are defined.
In both cases, reordering rules cannot be used.
This module allows to use stock request as reordering rules for this kind of
products.

It is created following the concept of lean kanban cards.

Configuration
=============

If the barcode does not contain a CRC check digit on the kanban card, you should:

* Access 'Settings / Technical / Parameters / System Parameters'
* Create a parameter with name 'stock_request_kanban.crc' and set it to value to 0

If the barcode contains a CRC check digit and you want to ignore it:

* Create a paramenter with name 'stock_request_kanban.ignore_crc' and set it to value to 1

If you want to change the format of the QR, you should:

* Access on Development mode
* Access 'Settings / Technical / Parameters / System Parameters'
* Create a parameter with name 'stock_request_kanban.barcode_format' and set
  the format of the barcode
