On most companies there are products that must be purchased often but cannot be
stored as a usual product because no consumption moves are made.
Usually, they are stored as consumables or putaway rules are defined.
In both cases, reordering rules cannot be used.
This module allows to use stock request as reordering rules for this kind of
products.

It is created following the concept of lean kanban cards.
