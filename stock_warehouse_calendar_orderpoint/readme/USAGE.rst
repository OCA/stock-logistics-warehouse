When dealing with reordering rules, the Reordering Calendar is considered in
the computation of the forecasted date to receive goods.
For example, if we plan to execute the reordering rules on a given weekday
(configuration of the Reordering Calendar), it will take this day as a
starting date instead of the current day (standard behavior).
