This module adds an Reordering Calendar to the Warehouse. This calendar
can then used by reordering rules to compute the forecasted date when goods
will be received.

**Table of contents**

   :local:

Configuration
=============

* Go to *Settings* and activate the developer mode.

* Go to *Settings > Technical > Resource > Working Time* and define your
  resource calendar.

* Go to *Inventory > Configuration > Settings > Warehouses*
  and assign the calendar to the "Reordering Calendar" field.
  This will be the default calendar for all newly created warehouses
  for the current company.
  Optionally, you can choose to postpone the computed lead date according
  to your workdays, and the policy to compute the next available workday.

* In *Inventory > Configuration > Warehouse Management > Warehouses*
  you can set a different calendar for your warehouse.

Usage
=====

When dealing with reordering rules, the Reordering Calendar is considered in
the computation of the forecasted date to receive goods.
For example, if we plan to execute the reordering rules on a given weekday
(configuration of the Reordering Calendar), it will take this day as a
starting date instead of the current day (standard behavior).
