By default, Odoo allows you to put items of any product into the same
location. This behaviour remains the one by default once the addon is
installed. Once installed, you can specify at any level of the stock
location hierarchy if you want to restrict the usage of the location to
only items of the same product. This property is inherited by all the
children locations while you don't specify an other specific value on a
child location. The constrains only applies location by location.

Once a location is configured to only contains items of the same
product, the system will prevent you to move items of any others
products into a location that already contains product items. A new
filter into the tree view of the stock locations will also allow you to
find all the location where this new restriction is violated.
