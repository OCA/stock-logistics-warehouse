============================
Stock Inventory POS category
============================

When you create an inventory, you can choose to select a particular product category. With this module, you can also choose to select one or more point of sale categories.

Usage
=====

Go to the menu *Inventory > Inventory Control > Inventory Adjustments*, create a new inventory and select *Point of Sale Categories* in the list, then choose the point of sale categories that you want to inventory.

Note that, if you select a parent point of sale category, Odoo will get the products attached to the children categories.
