DDMRP
=====

The Demand Driven Material Requirements Planning (DDMRP) is a multi-echelon
formal planning and execution technique with five distinct components:

* *Strategic inventory positioning*. Answers to the question: 'Given our system
  and environment, where should we place inventory to have the best protection?'
* *Buffer profiles and levels*. Allows to define the strategically positioned
  buffers (reordering rules in Odoo) to achieve the optimum levels of inventory.
* *Dynamic adjustments*. Buffers (reordering rules in Odoo) adapt dynamically
 to a changing environment conditions, such as demand, lead time or
 variability in supply.
* *Demand-driven planning*. Represents an intuitive method of supply order
  generation, based on the information provided by the buffers.
* *Highly visible and collaborative execution*. Simply launching purchase
  orders (POs), manufacturing orders (MOs) and transfer orders (TOs) from any
  planning system does not end the materials and order management challenge.
  These POs, MOs and TOs have to be effectively managed to synchronize with
  the changes that often occur within the "execution horizon."

These five components work together to greatly dampen, if not eliminate,
the nervousness of traditional MRP systems and the bullwhip effect in complex
and challenging environments.
