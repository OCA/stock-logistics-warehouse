When you organize the work into your warehouse you could need to search
for pickings related to a specific commercial entity. This use case could
be motivated by the fact that pickings for the same commercial entity
are usually delivered together.

This addon add on the picking form the "Commercial Entity" field the related
partner is part of. This field is readonly and comes from the partner information.
It also allows you to quickly search for pickings related to a specific
commercial entity and to group by this field in the picking tree view.
