When you organize the work into your warehouse you could need to search
for pickings related to a specific commercial entity. This use case
could be motivated by the fact that pickings for the same commercial
entity are usually delivered together.

This addon add on the picking form the "Commercial Entity" field the
related partner is part of. This field is readonly and comes from the
partner information. It also allows you to quickly search for pickings
related to a specific commercial entity and to group by this field in
the picking tree view.
