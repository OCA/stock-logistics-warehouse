Configuration
=============

The first step is to configure the Packaging Types (Pallet, Box, ...)
in Inventory > Configuration > Product Packaging Types.

Create a measuring device with a type set to "cubiscan".

Configure it. You can use the "Test Device" button to check the connection with the hardware.

Usage
=====

Use the "Wizard" button on a Measuring Device to open the screen and take
measurements.

For developers: a script in the directory ``scripts/cubiscan_stub.py`` allows
to simulate a Cubiscan server and send random measurements.
