This module allows users to check the quantity of a stocked product that is
available on-hand, and that has not yet been reserved for use anywhere else.

This key figure is very important during the monitoring of the warehouse
execution, because it assists users to ensure that the flow of products will
not be stuck due to a sudden unavailability of stock.

If the warehouse personnel ensures that the unreserved quantity on hand > 0,
then nobody will be stuck in pickings or manufacturing orders waiting for
the availability of unreserved stock.
