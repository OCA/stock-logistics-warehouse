This module adds completion information on stock picking.

If activated on the picking type, completion information is computed according
to the next chained pickings related to the stock moves of the actual picking.

In other words, if all the previous moves linked to the destination pickings
moves are done, the completion of the actual picking allows the destination
pickings to be processed. In such case, a ribbon will appear on the stock
picking form view, to inform the stock operator.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.
