The Specific Identification Valuation Method requires that products be tracked
by lot or serial number.  This method is typically applied in companies that
deal with a low volume of high-value items such as vehicles, jewelry, or custom
handicrafts.  It is also applied when buying and selling high-value used
products or collectables.

This method is appropriate in situations where the value of a specific serial
number is significantly different from that of another serial number of the
same product.  It is also appropriate where a specific serial number may have
significant changes in value over time, relative to other serial numbers of the
same product.
