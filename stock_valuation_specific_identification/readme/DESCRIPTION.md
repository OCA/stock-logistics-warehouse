The Specific Identification Inventory Valuation Method tracks value of specific
items in inventory based on lot or serial number. This method is distinguished
from FIFO, which groups pieces of inventory together based on when they
were purchased, and how much they cost.

This module adds fields to the valuation layer, so that costs can be tracked by
lot/serial.  This feature is associated with the product category.  In order to
enable Specific Identification, the user must choose the FIFO costing method for
the category.  Non-tracked products in the category will use the FIFO method.

Note that negative stock quantity is not allowed for products with Specific
Identification valuation.
