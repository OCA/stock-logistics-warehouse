The Specific Identification Inventory Valuation Method tracks value of
specific items in inventory based on lot or serial number. This method
is distinguished from FIFO, which groups pieces of inventory together
based on when they were purchased, and how much they cost.

This module adds fields to the valuation layer, so that costs can be
tracked by lot/serial. This feature is associated with the product
category. In order to enable Specific Identification, the user must
choose the FIFO costing method for the category. Non-tracked products in
the category will use the FIFO method.

Note that negative stock quantity is not allowed for products with
Specific Identification valuation.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Use Cases / Context
===================

The Specific Identification Valuation Method requires that products be
tracked by lot or serial number. This method is typically applied in
companies that deal with a low volume of high-value items such as
vehicles, jewelry, or custom handicrafts. It is also applied when buying
and selling high-value used products or collectables.

This method is appropriate in situations where the value of a specific
serial number is significantly different from that of another serial
number of the same product. It is also appropriate where a specific
serial number may have significant changes in value over time, relative
to other serial numbers of the same product.

Installation
============

For this module to be useful, you will need some accounting features. In
the community edition, you should install the OCA account_usability
module.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

1. Go to Inventory -> Configuration -> Product Categories
2. Set Inventory Valuation to Automated
3. Set Inventory Valuation Costing Method to FIFO
4. Check the box labeled "Cost by Lot/Serial"

Usage
=====

**Update Unit Price of Specific Lots/Serials**

-  Go to Inventory -> Reporting -> Valuation
-  Choose Group By -> Lot/Serial
-  Expand the row for a lot/serial that is configured for Specific
   Identification Valuation
-  Click the + (plus) button
-  Complete the Revaluation Wizard

**Feature Demonstration:**

In the following, we demonstrate two cases in which this module changes
the way stock valuation is performed by the system. To set up these
cases, we need to:

1. Configure a category for Specific Identification Valuation
2. Create a product, assigned to that category, with serial tracking
   enabled

**Specific identification of purchased value:**

1. Purchase one unit of the product on its own purchase order,
   serialized as SN01
2. Purchase a second unit of the product on a separate purchase order,
   with a different cost, serialized as SN02
3. Sell the second unit of the product (SN02) before selling the first
   (SN01)

With FIFO costing method, the outbound move for the sold unit would take
the value of the first unit purchased. This module changes the behavior
so that the value of the outbound move will be that of the second unit
(SN02).

**Specific identification of value changes:**

1. Manufacture two units of the product, serialized as SN03 and SN04
2. Revalue one of the serialized units
3. Sell the revalued unit

With FIFO costing method, the outbound move for the sold unit would be
valued as the total valuation for value of the first unit purchased.
This module changes the behavior so that the value of the outbound move
will be that of the second unit (SN02).

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

**Known Issues:**

-  In order to have different prices for different serialized units of
   the same product, create a separate purchase order for each serial
   number
-  When returning a delivery of multiple serialized units of the same
   product, each serial number must be returned separately
-  Negative stock quantities are not allowed for products with specific
   identification valuation
-  Modifying completed moves with multiple lots/serials is not allowed

**Future Improvements:**

-  Inherit and modify the wizard ``stock.valuation.layer.revaluation``,
   rather than creating a new wizard
   ``stock.valuation.layer.lot.revaluation``
-  Inherit and modify the product ``_run_fifo()`` method, rather than
   creating the lot ``_run_out_spec_ident`` method
