This module helps creating orderpoints automatically using templates.
A template is similar to an orderpoint, but it is not linked to a product.

When a picking is validated, the system will look for templates that match
the product and location of the picking. If there is no orderpoint but a 
template is found, it will create an orderpoint for the product and location
of the template.

The new orderpoint is linked to the template, and a change in the template values
will propagate to the orderpoints. To avoid this, you can unlink the orderpoint
by setting its template to False.

Usage
=====

Storage Locations should be enabled in Settings > Inventory > Warehouse.

A new menu entry will appear in Inventory > Configuration > Products > Reorder Rule Templates, 
where you can create new templates. Orderpoints will then automatically be created for all products
that need to be reordered, based on the template location.
