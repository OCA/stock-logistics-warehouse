  In order to check if the source location of a sale order line
  still use the location of the shop if not specified on the
  sale order line.
-
  !record {model: sale.order, id: sale_notsourced_01}:
    partner_id: base.res_partner_2
    note: Invoice after delivery
    order_line:
      - product_id: product.product_product_7
        product_uom_qty: 8
-
  When I confirm the sale order
-
  !workflow {model: sale.order, action: order_confirm, ref: sale_notsourced_01}
-
  Then a delivery order should have been generated
-
  !python {model: sale.order}: |
    sale_order = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("sale_notsourced_01"))
    assert len(sale_order.picking_ids) == 1, (
        "1 delivery order expected, got %d" % len(sale_order.picking_ids))
-
  And the source location of the stock move should be the one of
  the sales order's shop
-
  !python {model: sale.order}: |
    sale_order = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("sale_notsourced_01"))
    picking = sale_order.picking_ids[0]
    location_id = sale_order.shop_id.warehouse_id.lot_stock_id
    for move in picking.move_lines:
        assert move.location_id == location_id, (
            "Wrong location_id, expected %s, got %s" %
            (location_id, move.location_id))
        for procurement in move.procurements:
            assert procurement.location_id == location_id, (
                "Wrong location_id in procurement.order, expected %s, got %s" %
                (location_id, procurement.location_id))
