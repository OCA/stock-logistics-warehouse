This module allows you to add information about which quantities are in
which product packagings when checking stock levels (quants) for a given
product.

Use Cases / Context
===================

-  the stock.quant model in Odoo is used to store the stock levels of
   products in a warehouse
-  say we have 100 widgets in stock, 50 of them are conditioned in packs
   of 10, and 50 are in packs of 25
-  Odoo does not currently support this, moreover modifying the
   stock.quant model to take into account these packagings would be a
   hairy task as it is a core model that is read to/written to in many
   places
-  a simple solution is to create a new model and a computed field on
   stock.quants that will store this information

This module is especially relevant if you are using some form of
connector to another system, for example something like this :

https://github.com/OCA/wms/pull/762

For which you might want to bypass Odoo's tracking and only use the
other WMS's inventory as a single, overriding source of truth. Then you
can enrich data from the other WMS while still keeping Odoo's native
functionality in place.

Usage
=====

Enrich your stock.quants by creating linked stock_quant_packaging_info
records.
