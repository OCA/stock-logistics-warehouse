In the automatic flow option we will see that the options shown in the image are added.

If we activate the Stock Reservation option (note that the Validate order option must
be disabled) we indicate that the automatic flow process will reserve all those orders
that have this automatic flow selected, that amount of each line of the order.

You can set a maximum number of days that the stock can be reserved in the option
"Stock reservation validity (Days)" (Note that the planned action 'Release the stock
reservation having a passed validity date' must be activated in order to automatically
deactivate these quantities).

You can define the source locations and/or booking locations to use the automatic
workflow where the quantity to be booked will be taken and where this booked quantity
will be stored within odoo.
