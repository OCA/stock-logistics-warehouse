Allows to register a number of packages used during the put in pack.

If you put your goods in 3 boxes, then you can make 1 pack with a packages_nbr
of 3. This way, you don't need to care of what is in which box during the
packing operation but you can still transfer to the transporter the amount of
packages to collect and deliver.
