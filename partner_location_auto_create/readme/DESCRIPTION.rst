This module allows to create locations automatically when creating a partner.
One use case of this feature is to allow a company not only to manage the stocks
in its own warehouses, but also the warehouses of its suppliers.
For example, an hatchery manages farms. Each farm is a partner and has its own inventory.
The hatchery doesn't own the farms but manages their stocks.

Whether the partner is a customer, a supplier or both, the proper locations will be created and
the fields property_stock_customer and property_stock_supplier will be filled automatically.

The modules also adds a button on the partner form to view the related locations.
