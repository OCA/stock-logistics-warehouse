This module allows the system to propose automatically new procurement groups
when procuring.

This capability is important when you want to make sure that all the stock
moves resulting from this procurement will never be mixed with moves from
other groups in stock transfers.

The stock transfers resulting from the execution of these procurements will
only contain stock moves created from that procurement.
