Updating the Actual Date of a completed receipt picking for a foreign currency purchase does not trigger a recalculation of the amounts in the associated journal entries, even if the currency rate for the new date differs.

For the Actual Date of existing stock move and stock move line records created before this module was installed, the user's timezone will not be considered, and only the date part from the 'date' field in the UTC timezone will be assigned.
