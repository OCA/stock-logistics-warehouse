Use this module's function in the following situations:

* If you are late in processing a transfer or scrap in Odoo and wish to record the transaction with the actual transfer date, fill in the Actual Date field in the picking or scrap form. The Actual Date of the picking or scrap is then propagated to its corresponding stock moves and stock move lines, and is also passed to the journal entry as the date.
* You can also update the Actual Date of a completed picking or scrap if you belong to the Inventory Manager group. This operation updates the date of the related journal entries, re-proposing a new sequence to them as necessary.
