Business product location
=========================

The goal of this module is to manage a list of product and quantity attached
to a business and then define a business usage on stock location.
To begin define a list of product that must be in a stock location.
Depending on the business usage defined on the location, the list of product
is different, Locations with the same business usage always have the same
product list. Then it is possible to compare the theoretical list with the
real list of products (based on stock moves) for each location.
