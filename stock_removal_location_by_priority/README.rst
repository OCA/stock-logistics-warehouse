This module adds a removal priority field on stock locations.
This priority applies when removing a product from different stock locations
and the incoming dates are equal in both locations.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

You can activate the removal priority as follows:

#. Go to "Inventory > Configuration > Settings"
#. In 'Operations' section, mark the "Removal Priority" option.
#. You also need to activate the following settings in the section *Warehouse* if they are not yet:

   #. Manage several locations using *Storage Locations* option.
   #. Advanced routing using "Multi-Step Routes" option.

Then, set the *Removal Priority* in the desired locations. Remember that a
lower number means more priority:

#. Go to "Inventory > Configuration > Warehouse Management > Locations"
#. In each Location form, in the Logistics section, put a Removal Priority.

Usage
=====

After configure your locations properly, the system will select the quant
at the location with more priority in case of equal date, no matter if you
use FIFO or LIFO removal strategy.
