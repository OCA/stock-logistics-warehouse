You can activate the removal priority as follows:

#. Go to "Inventory > Configuration > Settings"
#. In 'Operations' section, mark the "Removal Priority" option.
#. You also need to activate the following settings in the section *Warehouse* if they are not yet:

   #. Manage several locations using *Storage Locations* option.
   #. Advanced routing using "Multi-Step Routes" option.

Then, set the *Removal Priority* in the desired locations. Remember that a
lower number means more priority:

#. Go to "Inventory > Configuration > Warehouse Management > Locations"
#. In each Location form, in the Logistics section, put a Removal Priority.
