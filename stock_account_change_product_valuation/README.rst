======================================
Stock Account Change Product Valuation
======================================

If your company runs a perpetual inventory system, changing the
product's costing method or the type of product requires proper readjustments:

Changing the type of product.

* From consumable to stockable: the resulting inventory value will be reset
  to 0, since everything that was received as a  stockable was expensed out
  at the time of entering the supplier invoice.

Changing the costing method:

* From standard or average to real: the cost of all the existing quants will
  be reset to the product's standard price.

* From real to standard or average: the standard price of the product
  template will be set to the average unit cost of all the internal quants.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Pending to do:

* From stockable to consumable: The inventory value should be
  completely removed. Most importantly when you run a perpetual inventory
  (connected with accounting)
