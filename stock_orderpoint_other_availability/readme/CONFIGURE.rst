Create an orderpoint with `Check availability of another product` enabled, then set:

- The product whose availability you want to check.
- The minimum availability that the configured product should have, otherwise this orderpoint is triggered.
- (Only if multi-location is enabled) The location for computing the configured minimum availability.
