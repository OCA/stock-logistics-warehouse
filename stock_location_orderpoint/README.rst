Declare orderpoint on a location allowing to replenish any product with the same criteria.
This is for an internal warehouse replenishment currently not compatible with the purchase buy route.

Configuration
=============

First configuration
===================

#. In order to replenish your stock location from another one, you first need
   to set the multi locations configuration.
#. So, go to Inventory > Configuration > Settings > Warehouse
#. Check the 'Storage Locations' box.
#. As you should be able to configure a dedicated route to replenishment, you
   should also activate, in the same menu, the 'Multi-Step Routes' box.

Locations configuration
=======================

#. Identify the location you want to apply a replenishment rule (e.g.: WH/Stock)
#. Create (if not exists) a new location for replenishment under Warehouse view (e.g.: WH)
   location as we want to get the stock in replenishment taken into account of
   our product stock total quantity.

Route Configuration
===================

#. You should configure at least a route with a rule that:

    * Pull from the Replenishment stock location.
    * For the stock location you want to (e.g.: WH/Stock)

Location Orderpoint configuration
=================================

#. Go either by the stock location you want to replenish and click on 'Orderpoints'
   or go to Inventory > Configuration > Warehouse > Stock Location Orderpoint
#. Click on 'Create'
#. Set a sequence
#. Choose if the rule will be applied:

    * Automatically (Auto/realtime): at each stock movement on the stock location, the rule will be
      evaluated.
    * Manually (Manual): If set, an action 'Run Replenishment' will be displayed on the rule
      and allow to run it manually.
    * by cron (Scheduled): A cron job will trigger the replenishment rules of this kind.
#. Choose a replenish method:

    * Fill up: The replenishment will be triggered when a move is waiting availability
      and forecast quantity is negative at the location (i.e. min=0). The replenished quantity will
      bring back the forecast quantity to 0 (i.e. max=0) but will be limited to what is available at
      the source location to plan only reservable replenishment moves.
#. Choose the location to replenish
#. Choose the route to use to replenish. The source location will be computed automatically based on
   the route value.
#. Define a procurement group if you want to group some movements together.
#. Define a priority for the created moves.
