Validating some operations is a common need across different areas in a company
and sometimes it also involves several people and stages in the process. With
this module you will be able to define your custom validation workflows for
any Odoo document.

This module does not provide a functionality by itself but an abstract model
to implement a validation process based on tiers on other models (e.g.
purchase orders, sales orders, budgets, expenses...).

**Note:** To be able to use this module in a new model you will need some
development.

See `purchase_tier_validation <https://github.com/OCA/purchase-workflow>`_ as an example of implementation.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Settings > Technical > Tier Validations > Tier Definition*.
#. Create as many tiers as you want for any model having tier validation
   functionality.

**Note:**

* If check *Notify Reviewers on Creation*, all possible reviewers will be notified by email when this definition is triggered.
* If check *Comment*, reviewers can comment after click Validate or Reject.
* If check *Approve by sequence*, reviewers is forced to review by specified sequence.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

This is the list of known issues for this module. Any proposal for improvement will
be very valuable.

* **Issue:**

  When using `approve_sequence` option in any tier.definition there can be inconsistencies
  in the systray notifications.

  **Description:**

  Field `can_review` in tier.review is used to filter out, in the systray notifications,
  the reviews a user can approve. This `can_review` field is updated **in the database**
  in method `review_user_count`, this can make it very inconsistent for databases
  with a lot of users and recurring updates that can change the expected behavior.

* **Migration to 15.0:**

  The parameter _tier_validation_manual_config will become False, on 14.0, the default
  value is True, as the change is applied after the migration. In order to use the new
  behavior we need to modify the value on our expected model.
