This is the list of known issues for this module. Any proposal for improvement will
be very valuable.

* **Issue:**

  When using `approve_sequence` option in any tier.definition there can be inconsistencies
  in the systray notifications.

  **Description:**

  Field `can_review` in tier.review is used to filter out, in the systray notifications,
  the reviews a user can approve. This `can_review` field is updated **in the database**
  in method `review_user_count`, this can make it very inconsistent for databases
  with a lot of users and recurring updates that can change the expected behavior.

* **Migration to 15.0:**

  The parameter _tier_validation_manual_config will become False, on 14.0, the default
  value is True, as the change is applied after the migration. In order to use the new
  behavior we need to modify the value on our expected model.
