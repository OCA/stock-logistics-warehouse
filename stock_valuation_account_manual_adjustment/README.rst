This module shows in the product inventory stock value and the accounting
value, and allows to create accounting adjustment entries to align the
accounting value to match with the inventory stock value.

Configuration
=============

Assign the group 'Stock Valuation Account Manual Adjustments' to the users
that should be allowed to list the valuation discrepancies and to reconcile
them.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

* Go to 'Inventory / Inventory Control / Perpetual Inventory Valuation'

* Filter using the filter 'Valuation Discrepancy' which filters out
  products with no Valuation Discrepancy.

* Select the products that you wish to reconcile and press 'Action /
  Adjust Stock Valuation Account Discrepancies'.

* You can provide Valuation Increase/Decrease Contra-Account. Otherwise the
  application will attempt to use the ones defined in the product category.
  Note that when the adjustment implies an increase of the valuation of your
  inventory (thus a debit), the account 'Valuation Increase Contra-Account')
  will be used in the credit side of the journal entry. And when the
  inventory valuation is going to decrease (credit), the account 'Valuation
  Decrease Contra-Account' will be used in the debit side of the journal
  entry. Typically the 'Valuation Increase Contra-Account' will be of type
  'Equity' and 'Valuation Decrease Contra-Account' will be of type 'Expense'.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* In order to properly manage the inventory valuation from an accounting
  perspective all journal items created for inventory accounts should
  include the product.
* The price change function of Odoo creates journal entries to the inventory
  account without specifying the product. This is bad because you lose the
  ability to control the inventory valuation from accounting at the level of
  the product. In order to fix this, use the module
  'stock_inventory_revaluation', to be found in the same OCA repository.

Points to be considered by contributors for future improvements are:

* This module does not support multi-company environments currently.
* Obtaining the valuation by product is currently mainly done by raw SQL
  queries. This could be improved to take advantage of ORM methods (like
  `read_group`)
