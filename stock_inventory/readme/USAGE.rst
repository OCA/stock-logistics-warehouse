Go to Inventory / Operations / Inventory Adjustments. Here you can see the list of Adjustment Grouped.
If you create a new Group, you can choose 2 types of product selection:
- All Products (all products from theselected locations).
- Manual Selection (choose manually each product in location).
- One Product (choose only one product in locations).
- Lot Serial Number (choose one product, any lots and locations).
- Product Category (choose one product category [childs also taken into account]).
When you start the adjustment (only one at a time) clicking on adjustments gets you to the view where adjustments are made.
From the group view, if you click on Stock Moves you can see the movements done (includes the 0 qty moves).
