Configuration
=============

The first step is to configure the Packaging Types (Pallet, Box, ...) in Inventory > Configuration > Product Packaging Types.

Configure the Cubiscan device in Inventory > Configuration > Cubiscan Devices.
Use the "Test Device" to check the connection with the hardware.

Usage
=====

Use the "Wizard" button on a Cubiscan device to open the screen and take
measurements.

For developers: a script in the directory ``scripts/cubiscan_stub.py`` allows
to simulate a Cubiscan server and send random measurements.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* The UI could get some improvements
* Being able to open the Cubiscan screen from a product would be nice
