This module allows you to define template of location with list of products and quantities supposed to be there.

We didn't use reordering rules for maintenance purposes: Reordering rules need to be defined and maintained for each location. If you have hundreds of locations, updating one template is more convenient than updating hundreds of rules.

It also provides a report with the delta between expected and on-hand quantities and a button to replenish; and a way to check each location against its template.
