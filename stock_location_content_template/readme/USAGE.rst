Transactions

* Go to Inventory > Operations > Checkouts
* Create a checkout
* Select a location, a date, assign it to a user and confirm
* As the user, enter the counted and replenished quantities and complete:

  - a delivery order is created with the missing quantities (current - counted)
  - an internal transfer is created with the replenished quantities

* As the manager, you can review the checkouts and close them: the delivery order and internal transfer previously created are transferred and done.

Reporting

* Go to Inventory > Reporting > Content Report
* Review each location and their missing items
* Create the internal transfer to replenish those locations and reach the expected quantities from their template
