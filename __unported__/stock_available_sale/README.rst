Quotations in quantity available to promise
===========================================

This module computes the quoted quantity of each Product, and subtracts it from
the quantity available to promise.

"Quoted" is defined as the sum of the quantities of this Product in
Sale Quotations, taking the context's shop or warehouse into account.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

This module does not warn salespersons when the quantity available to promise
is insufficient to deliver a sale order line.

Work to add this feature is underway: https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-warehouse/pull/25
