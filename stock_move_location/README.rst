This module allows to move entire location of products from one place to
another and move only selected quants.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Usage
=====

* A new menuitem Stock > Move from location... opens a wizard
  where 2 location ca be specified.
* Select origin and destination locations and press "IMMEDIATE TRANSFER" or "PLANNED TRANSFER"
* Press `ADD ALL` button to add all products available
* Those lines can be edited. Move quantity can't be more than a max available quantity
* Move doesn't care about the reservations and will move stuff anyway
* If during your operation with the wizard the real quantity will change
  it will move only the available quantity at the button press
* Products will be moved and a form view of picking that did that will show up
* If "PLANNED TRANSFER" is used - the picking won't be validated automatically

If you want to transfer a full quant:

*  Go to `Inventory > Master Data > Products` and click "On hand" smart button
   or `Inventory > Reporting > Inventory`, the quants view will be
   opened.

*  Select the quants which you want move to another location

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Change the current implementation (suggested by Denis Roussel from ACSONE):

* A new parameter on stock picking types : 'Product Change Location' (with a little help).
* With this, go to the dashboard, create a picking with that type.
* Add a button on the picking form which is visible with that type that fill in the picking as now
* Nice to have: add a magic button on locations that with context creates a new picking of that type with the origin location already filled in.
