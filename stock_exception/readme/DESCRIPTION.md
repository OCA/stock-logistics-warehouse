This module allows you attach several customizable exceptions to your
stock picking in a way that you can filter pickings by exceptions type
and fix them. Exceptions are checked via a scheduled action as well as
during confirmation and validation.

This is especially useful in an scenario for mass stock picking import,
because it's likely some pickings have errors when you import them (like
product not found in Odoo, wrong line format etc.)
