This module allows you attach several customizable exceptions to your
stock picking in a way that you can filter pickings by exceptions type and fix them.

This is especially useful in an scenario for mass stock picking import, because it's likely some pickings have
errors when you import them (like product not found in Odoo, wrong line
format etc.)
